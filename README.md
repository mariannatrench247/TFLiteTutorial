# TFLiteTutorial

## **Welcome!**

### I created this TFLiteTutorial page to help direct future collaborators/recruiters to the organization process of converting TensforFlow Models to TF Lite. 
### By the time this Tutorial is completed, I would like a normal person to be able to load and run a neural network onto a microcontroller successfully.

This is the route I have taken, through trial and error. I really enjoyed this process and I hope you do too!
